Software Engineering Project 2020/2021 - University of Salerno

The site offers a service for selling and buying university teaching materials, specifically notes and video lectures. The extensive catalog has teaching materials available at any time at an affordable price, without wasting paper. Users can choose to create a different account depending on their needs: create a Buyer account if they intend to buy, create a Seller account if they want to upload notes intended for sale.
